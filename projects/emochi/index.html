                    <p>We were given "Education" as a topic for the project and we decided to focus on education during teen years. From that, we embarked on a mission to find and tackle some of the educational pain points that appear in those teen years of growing and evolving as persons.</p>

                    <h3>Why teenage education?</h3>
                    <p>After we were given Education as a topic, we started going through all of our educational experience and found that some of the most vivid memories were from a specific time: our teenage years. It's a time of self-definition, making important decisions and a lot of changes.</p>
                    <p class="u-mb2">So that's why we decided to focus our research on high school teachers and students (from 12 to 16 years old).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="case-study__section aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="6000">
                    <h3>Surveys, observation and interviews</h3>
                    <p class="u-mb2">Our first apporach was with two rounds of online surveys to both teachers and students, so that we could start narrowing down the topics and areas where we could find opportunities. We also assisted and observed a couple of student groups during classes.</p>
                    <picture>
                        <source srcset="" type="image/webp">

                    </picture>
                    <p>Then we casually interviewed teachers and students to refine the questions and topics we had gathered from the surveys and observation. To cover all the spectrum and it's extremes, we interviewed teachers and students from different centres, from religious private ones to secular public ones.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we built a script and did more in-depth and structured interviews, this time only to teachers. The focus on teachers only was due to the constraints of interviewing students (permits  were required due to them being underage).</p>

                    <p>Research final numbers:</p>
                    <p><strong>Surveys</strong>: +50 answers</p>
                    <p><strong>Observation</strong>: 3hs</p>
                    <p><strong>Interviews</strong>: +13hs</p>

                    <p class="u-mb2">With all the information gathered during the research we created our two user personas:</p>
                    
                    <p class="u-mb0"><strong>Student</strong></p>
                    <p>Xavi is a 14-year-old student who is always on the phone, has a very active life and is bored by homework, that’s why he needs motivation and more dynamic learning activities.</p>

                    <p class="u-mb0"><strong>Teacher</strong></p>
                    <p>Miquel is a teacher and tutor for boys like Xavi. He is someone who likes to include digital solutions in the academic field to obtain more dynamic results and has the need to empower his students.</p>

                    <h3>Our own bias</h3>
                    <p class="u-mb2">We were biased by our own experience in high school, so we thought the mainunsolve problems would be the lack of digital tools use and boring long hours of master lectures. But to our surprise, we discovered that times have changed and there are many apps to keep kids interested (kahoot, quizzit, etc.).</p>

                    <h3>So, what did we discovered?</h3>
                    <p>We found two main problems:</p>
                    <picture>
                        <source srcset="" type="image/webp">

                    <p class="u-mb0"><strong>Different learning levels</strong></p>
                    <p>In a same group there might be an ADHD kid along with a genius IQ score kid. That affects both teacher and student, as the teacher needs to adapt the content to each one of them and adjust it to their level, and the student might not be getting the attention or support needed to evolve properly.</p>
                    <q>Attending diversity correctly is, many times, a problem to be overcome in each class.</q>

                    <p class="u-mb0"><strong>Lack of emotional intelligence</strong></p>
                    <p>Bullying, fights and lack of emotion control. External problems that make impossible for the teacher to carry out the lesson, as he needs to deal with all those problems. Students who doesn’t know how to solve their own issues in a mature way and can’t deal with negative results or critiques.</p>
                    <q>Solving current student problems and dealing with emotional intelligence is a challenge for me, we were never taught how to do it correctly.</q>

                    <p class="u-mb2">As his driver, our teacher persona had the need to accompany students in their personal and academic development. To help them learn all required topics but also help them develop as individuals.</p>

                    <p>And these were the opportunities we found:</p>
                    <ul class="about__list">
                        <li>Boost emotional development</li>
                        <li>Improve individual monitoring</li>
                        <li>Create a bond with the students</li>
                        <li>Simplify the content creation process</li>

                    <h3>Customer Journey Map</h3>
                    <p class="u-mb2">We created a Customer Journey Map based on the teacher's entire lesson experience, from planning the content, to teaching the class and evaluating the students. </p>

                    </picture>
                    <p>We identified many pain points but attempting to solve them all would've been an impossible task within the time we had, so we decided to focused on these four:</p>
                    <ul class="about__list">
                        <li>Adapting content to each student's need</li>
                        <li>Dealing with conflicts between students</li>
                        <li>Helping students individually</li>
                        <li>Dealing with student’s negative reactions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We realised these needs could be solved with a tool that would help students individually to improve their emotional intelligence to help them deal with everyday problems. And therefore it would help the teacher to smooth out the process of teaching and accompanying the student.</p>

                    <p class="u-mb2">There are different types of challenges but all of them have the same goals: help the student to better understand himself or others by interacting with his Emochi. The challenges involve the student and his Emochi by creating stories, situations or questions to work the different emotional intelligence components.</p>

                    <p class="u-mb2">Once the challenge is solved, the student receives constructive feedback that helps him improve his development. He will improve the stats of the component he worked, according to the answers given. Also, if he levels up, he will earn a trophy related to that new knowledge. These trophies want to recognise the student’s efforts and encourage him to continue working on his emotional development.</p>

                    <p class="u-mb2">In addition, the Emochi also increases it's level, since it is the companion of the student. When the Emochi increases it's level, it unlocks add-ons and other customizations.</p>
