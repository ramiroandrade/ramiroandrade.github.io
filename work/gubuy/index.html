                <p class="case-study__chapter">Introduction</p>
                <h3 class="case-study__h3">Client</h3>
                <p class="case-study__paragraph">The uruguayan government needed a consistent and unified language for the online interactions between the citizens and the state dependencies.</p>
                <h3 class="case-study__h3">Challenge</h3>
                <p class="case-study__paragraph">This was a project that took many years, many iterations and many tries. Making something this big, and doing it in the public sector, requires a lot of patience, hard work and motivation.</p>
                <h3 class="case-study__h3">Project</h3>
                <p class="case-study__paragraph">It's hard to set a starting date because there were a lot of pauses and fresh starts, but I can say that when I joined <a href="https://concreta.com.uy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concreta</a> (the company who provided digital design services to the government) in 2012 the idea was already being talked about. The project had many steps and iterations, to the point that it's still a work in progress up to this day (I havent work on it since 2019).</p>
                <p class="case-study__paragraph">At the beginning we didn´t have every dependency's support, but many of them join the project along the way. It became a huge deal and now you can see most of, if not all, the big state dependencies have joined.</p>

                <p class="case-study__chapter">1. The concept</p>
                <h2 class="case-study__h2">Creating a common digital language for all the interactions with the government</h2>
                <p class="case-study__paragraph">As we worked with many different state dependencies, we saw that users had to learn each dependency's patterns and language for every procedure they needed to do. So we proposed to unify languages and create a similar experience as to what the UK government achieved with their digital transformation.</p>
                <p class="case-study__paragraph">Because this was a government language/system, it had to be intuitive, usable and accesible, so that it could be used by a large user base composed of all of Uruguay's citizens (well, mainly from people from 12 to 80 years old). Also, It had to be fully responsive, a concept that wasn´t too spread out between the dependencies at that moment.</p>

                <p class="case-study__chapter">2. Components</p>
                <h2 class="case-study__h2">Designing a great library of components to cater every need</h2>
                <p class="case-study__paragraph">I was in charge of designing the logo, iconography and interface elements of the app, as well as the design and front-end development of its website (landing page).</p>

                <p class="case-study__chapter">3. Page templates</p>
                <h2 class="case-study__h2">Building page templates for particular and specific use cases</h2>
                <p class="case-study__paragraph">Not only did we work on atoms, molecules and organisms (terms used by Brad Frost in his <a href="https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atomic Design Methodology</a>), but we also created page templates. This templates were created mainly as guides for how to use and combine the components we had designed.</p>

                <p class="caption">Fequently asked questions template</p>
                <p class="case-study__paragraph">But, as time went by, they started asking us for templates for special use cases. You can´t imagine the amount of special cases there are, but we tried to reuse components and templates as much as we could.</p>

                <p class="caption">Fequently asked questions template</p>
                <p class="case-study__paragraph">We ended up creating many variants for a lot of the components so that we could meet the dependecies' requirements but without compromising the design system.</p>
                <p class="case-study__chapter">4. Forms</p>
                <h2 class="case-study__h2">Putting an emphasis on the tool that citizens use the most</h2>
                <p class="case-study__paragraph">Beside designing components and templates for the institutional websites, we focused a lot on forms. These are the tools through which the users interact with the state.</p>
